# First Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below:

If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools](tutorials-using-other-tools).

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

## Create a Branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-msc-kiit
```

The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.

---

## Make Necessary Changes and Commit the Changes

Now open `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors' List"
```

By replacing `<your-name>` with your full name.

---

## Push Changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

By replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

---

## Submit Your Changes for Review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon all your changes will be merged into the master branch of this project. You will also get a notification e-mail once the changes have been merged.

---
